```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load dplyr

```{r}
##install.packages("dplyr") #we install dplyr, and we do this only once (so I added ##s before it once I did, so it won't repeat)

library(dplyr)


```

##Load

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
