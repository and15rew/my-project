## we selected "new project", then found and selected the my-project file that I made in github (online) and downloaded into the github (app)

##now, I selected a new R markdown document, downloaded the package, installed the package, and the below is what popped up

---
title: "Untitled"
output: html_document ##we can change this to a pdf document, word doc, slide show, etc.

##these shadowy grey things are called chuncks.  It's allowing us to run R code and then render the output of that R code.  This first chunk is called setup, this particularly one is a title.  Anything inside the {} gets evaluated in the r engine
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r testing testing}
x<-2
```
